## Completed Enhancements

1. ✅ **Search panel entrance animation** — fade-in, slide-up, scale with blur on hero load (0.3s delay, 0.8s duration)
2. ✅ **Gold hover micro-interactions on property cards** — gold border glow, shadow enhancement, subtle lift (-translate-y-1) on hover
3. ✅ **Hero-to-content gold divider** — decorative gradient line with gold glow between hero and featured section
4. ✅ **Gold shimmer loading skeletons** — all Skeleton components and PropertyCardSkeleton use gold-primary/15 shimmer instead of white/gray
5. ✅ **Mobile & accessibility optimizations** — `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all animations; mobile parallax disabled

## Next Steps

1. **Add scroll-triggered reveal animations** — fade-in property sections and widgets as they enter the viewport using IntersectionObserver
2. **Implement dark mode gold theme refinements** — ensure gold accents have proper contrast and glow effects in dark mode
3. **Add page transition animations** — smooth transitions when navigating between pages using framer-motion
4. **Performance audit** — run Lighthouse and optimize LCP, CLS, and FID scores
