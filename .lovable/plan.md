Based on the recent work implementing the gold theme across the hero section, search panel, and sticky header, here are logical next steps to continue enhancing the site:

1. **Add a subtle entrance animation to the search panel** — fade-in and slide-up when the hero section loads, giving a polished first impression.
2. **Add hover micro-interactions to search result cards** — gold border glow, subtle lift, and shadow enhancement on property cards for consistency with the luxury theme.
3. **Implement a smooth transition between the hero parallax and the featured section** — a decorative gold divider or gradient fade to elegantly connect the two sections.
4. **Add loading skeleton states with gold accent shimmer** — replace default gray skeleton loaders with gold-tinted shimmer animations that match the branding.
5. **Optimize parallax and animations for mobile performance** — disable or reduce parallax intensity on mobile devices, and use `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for accessibility.
