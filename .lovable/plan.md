## Status: Plan Already Implemented

The gold hover micro-interactions plan from `.lovable/plan.md` has already been completed:

- **CompactPropertyCard** — Already uses `hover:border-gold-primary/40` and `hover:shadow-[0_8px_30px_-8px_hsl(var(--gold-primary)/0.2)]`
- **ASTRAVillaPropertyCard** — Already uses `hover:border-gold-primary/40` and `hover:shadow-[0_8px_30px_-8px_hsl(var(--gold-primary)/0.2)]`

No further changes are needed. The project's gold theme refinements are complete across:
- Dark mode contrast and glow utilities
- Gold shimmer loading skeletons
- Parallax/animation accessibility (mobile + reduced motion)
- Gold sparkle hero effect
- Gold hover micro-interactions on all property cards

What would you like to work on next?
