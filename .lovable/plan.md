Looking at what's been accomplished so far in this conversation:

1. ✅ Staggered per-card fade-in animations (100ms delay between cards)
2. ✅ Fixed duplicate React instance errors (vite.config.ts dedupe)
3. ✅ Verified animations on mobile and desktop
4. ✅ Alternating scroll directions per section (left/right zigzag)

The animation system is solid. Here are some natural next steps to consider.
