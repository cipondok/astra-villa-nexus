```

### Testing Reduced Motion

#### Option 1: Debug Panel (Recommended for Development)

1. Start the development server
2. Look for the **Settings** button in the bottom-left corner
3. Click to open the Animation Debug panel
4. Toggle animations on/off instantly
5. Reset to system settings when done

#### Option 2: System Settings

**macOS:**
```
System Settings → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion
```

**Windows:**
```
Settings → Accessibility → Visual effects → Animation effects
```

**Linux (GNOME):**
```
Settings → Accessibility → Seeing → Reduced animation
```

## Debug Panel Features

The debug panel appears only in development mode and provides:

- **Current Status Display**: Shows whether reduced motion is ON or OFF
- **Manual Override**: Toggle animations without changing OS settings
- **Override Indicator**: Visual warning when manual override is active
- **Reset Button**: One-click return to system preferences
- **Persistent Settings**: Override saved to localStorage across sessions
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + D` - Toggle debug panel open/closed
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + A` - Toggle animations on/off directly
  - `Cmd/Ctrl + R` - Reset to system settings (clears override)
  - `?` or `Cmd/Ctrl + /` - Show keyboard shortcuts help modal

### Using the Debug Panel

**With Mouse/Touch:**
1. Click the ⚙️ Settings icon in the bottom-left corner
2. The panel shows current animation state
3. Click "Enable Animations" or "Disable Animations" to toggle
4. Click "Reset to System Setting" to clear manual override
5. Close the panel with the X button (your settings persist)

**With Keyboard:**
- `Cmd/Ctrl + D` - Open/close the debug panel
- `Cmd/Ctrl + A` - Instantly toggle animations on/off
- `Cmd/Ctrl + R` - Reset to system settings (if override is active)
- `?` or `Cmd/Ctrl + /` - View all keyboard shortcuts

💡 **Tip**: Press `?` anytime to see all available keyboard shortcuts in a help modal!

## Visual Indicators

### Console Logs (Development)
- `✨ Accessibility: Full animations enabled` - Normal animation mode
- `🎯 Accessibility: Reduced motion mode is ACTIVE` - Simplified animations
- `🔧 Dev Override: Reduced motion manually set to ON/OFF` - Manual toggle used

### On-Screen Badge (Development)
A "Reduced Motion" badge appears above the chat button when reduced motion is active, helping you verify the current state at a glance.

### Onboarding Tooltip (First Visit)
On your first visit in development mode, an interactive tooltip appears to introduce you to:
- Debug panel features
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Quick start guide

The tooltip:
- Appears automatically after 1.5 seconds
- Can be dismissed with "Got It" or "Try It Now" buttons
- Never shows again (tracked in localStorage)
- Can be reset by clearing localStorage key: `debug-panel-onboarding-seen`

### E2E Testing Features

- **Cross-browser testing**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Safari, Mobile Chrome
- **Mobile testing**: iPhone and Android viewports
- **Visual regression testing**: Automated screenshot comparison to detect UI changes
- **Performance monitoring**: Lighthouse CI for Core Web Vitals and metrics
- **Trace viewer**: Debug failed tests with timeline
- **Parallel execution**: Fast test runs
- **Auto-wait**: Smart element waiting
- **HTML Reporter**: Beautiful test reports

### Performance Monitoring (Lighthouse CI)

Lighthouse CI automatically measures and tracks Core Web Vitals and performance metrics:

**What's measured:**
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS
- **Performance metrics**: FCP, TBT, Speed Index, TTI
- **Scores**: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO
- **Resource budgets**: HTML, JS, CSS, images, fonts
- **Optimization opportunities**: Image optimization, caching, minification

**Running Lighthouse:**
```bash
# Interactive local test
bash scripts/lighthouse-local.sh

# Generate detailed report
bash scripts/performance-report.sh

# View results
open .lighthouseci/*.html
```

**Performance Budgets:**
- Performance Score: > 90% (desktop), > 85% (mobile)
- LCP: < 2.5s
- CLS: < 0.1
- Total Page Size: < 2MB
- JavaScript: < 500KB

**CI Integration:**
- Runs on every PR and deployment
- Comments scores on pull requests
- Fails build if budgets exceeded
- Tracks metrics over time

### Visual Regression Testing

The project includes comprehensive visual regression testing to automatically detect unintended UI changes:

**How it works:**
1. Baseline screenshots are captured for each component state
2. Future test runs compare new screenshots against baselines
3. Tests fail if visual differences exceed configured thresholds
4. Diff images highlight exact pixel differences

**What's tested:**
- Component appearance (normal, hover, focus states)
- Layout at 7+ responsive breakpoints
- Dark mode vs Light mode
- All interactive states (buttons, panels, modals)
- Typography and text rendering
- Gradients, shadows, and visual effects
- Edge cases (narrow viewports, text overflow)

**Managing baselines:**
```bash
# When you make intentional UI changes, update baselines:
bash scripts/update-screenshots.sh

# Or update a specific test:
npx playwright test e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts --update-snapshots

# Review differences in the HTML report:
npx playwright show-report
```

**Configuration:**
- `maxDiffPixels`: 100 pixels allowed difference
- `threshold`: 0.2 (20% color difference tolerance)
- Animations disabled for consistent captures
- Baselines stored in `e2e/*.spec.ts-snapshots/`

### Writing Tests

Unit tests are located next to the files they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension. E2E tests are in the `e2e/` directory. All unit tests run in a jsdom environment with automatic cleanup after each test.
