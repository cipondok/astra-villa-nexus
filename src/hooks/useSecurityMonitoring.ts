/**
 * DEPRECATED: Client-side security monitoring is insecure
 * 
 * This hook has been removed for security reasons. All security monitoring,
 * risk calculation, and behavioral profiling MUST be done server-side to 
 * prevent client-side manipulation and bypass attacks.
 * 
 * Security features are now handled by:
 * - useAdvancedAuthSecurity hook (server-validated)
 * - Edge functions for authentication
 * - Database-backed security logs (user_security_logs table)
 * - RLS policies for access control
 * 
 * DO NOT re-implement client-side security checks.
